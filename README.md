# Renal Failure Risk Assessment with Data Science

This Project is based on to indicate Chronic kidney disease or to Predict the Kidney failure using Machine learning Algorithms.

EDA and Performance Evaluation of Each Model has been done.

It is implemented with 5 Supervised Classification Machine Learning Algorithms : Logistic regression, Support vector Machine, Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision tree, Random forest classifier.

This model gets multiple attributes like Blood Pressure , RBC count ,WBC count etc,., as the independent input variables and predicts the output for the categorical data(weather the person diagonised Renal failure or not).

This model is implemented using above algorithms as a sub modules and made as an single app using streamlit and deployed.
